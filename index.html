            <p id="text1">No the title isn't wrong, every day is mothers day. At least it should be. But today, as it is the day you gave birth to me, should be mothers day moreso than any other day. I simply could not be here without you, and it is a special day for you as much as it is for me. I wanted to make something different, as I usually try to make a card because I feel it is more sincere. Most of all, I wanted something to show that I appreciate you and all that you do, regardless if I can remember to thank you 100% of the time.</p>

                Although we don't always get along, or agree on everything, I still am very thankful that we at least have a relationship where we can still talk in the end and make it work out. I wouldn't want to have any other mother. (I wanted to have a picture of us but I found this funny one of bella instead)
